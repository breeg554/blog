Optimizing a website for SEO is crucial nowadays. Every blog owner aims to elevate their website's position in Google search results, but how can this be achieved?

There are several important considerations to keep in mind, and [sitemaps](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) rank high among them.

## What is the sitemap.xml file?

The sitemap.xml file is essentially an XML-formatted file (wow ðŸ¥¸) that contains information about the various subpages within our website. It helps search robots, such as [Googlebot](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot?hl=pl), better comprehend the structure of our website, making it indispensable for SEO.

## How to add sitemap file to Next.js website?

Of course, you can create this file manually. Its structure is straightforward:

- Begin with the standard protocol by creating a [urlset](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) tag.
- Craft a **url** tag for every individual subpage you have on your site.
- Incorporate a **loc** tag (indicating location) for each parent url tag.

The example of simple **sitemap.xml** file might look like:

```xml
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://your_webiste_url.com</loc>
  </url>
  ...others subpages
</urlset>
```

Once you've defined your other subpages, put this file in the **/public** directory. Done!

Your sitemap is now accessible at **www.your_website_url.com/sitemap.xml**. Pretty straightforward, right?

However, manually updating the sitemap after each change could get tedious. Thankfully, Next.js have a solution for that!

## Dynamic sitemap file in Next app directory.

All you need to do is add **sitemap.ts** file to the **/app** directory and return an array reflecting your website's structure.

```ts
// /app/sitemap.ts

export default async function sitemap() {
  return ['','/your_first_subpage'].map((route) => ({
    url: `www.your_website_url.com${route}`,
    lastModified: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  }));
}
```
Great, but what if you wish to include dynamic pages from, for example, your database or from your blog's MDX files? (Check out my [previous post](/contentlayer-and-nextjs) on how to easily set up Contentlayer in your Next.js app).

It's not complex at all. Simply fetch the desired data within this file and merge the results with your pre-defined sitemap URLs.

```ts
// /app/sitemap.ts

export default async function sitemap() {
  const allPosts = await fetchPosts() // fetch data about your posts

  const posts = allPosts.map((post) => ({
    url: `www.your_website_url.com/${post.slug}`,
    lastModified: post.publishedAt.split('T')[0],
  }));

  const routes =  ['','/your_first_subpage'].map((route) => ({
    url: `www.your_website_url.com${route}`,
    lastModified: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  }));

  return [...routes,...posts]
}
```

Now visit **www.your_website_url.com/sitemap.xml** and see your dynamically generated sitemap.xml file!

## Summary

As you can see, adding sitemap in Next 13 is quite simple. Now you can submit a link to this sitemap file in your google search console!
